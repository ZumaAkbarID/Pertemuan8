        <p class="my-3 text-justify">
          King Camp Gillette and his amazing razor were the first disruptors of the grooming
          category as well as the barbershop industry. Men’s facial trends were changing rapidly in
          the late 1800s. Long beards were out while clean chins and cheeks and a well-manicured
          mustache were in. To achieve this look, men could go to a barber two to three times per
          week or shave themselves, which could be a dangerous undertaking.
        </p>
        <p class="my-3 text-justify">
          Standing at his sink in the early morning, King C. Gillette realized his permanent blade
          razor was dull and required professional sharpening. In that moment of frustration, he saw
          that the only necessary part of his blade was the finest part of the tip. He quickly
          envisioned that tip on a flattened piece of steel, sharpened on both sides, produced at
          such a low cost that it was easily and quickly replaceable. King C. Gillette’s new,
          disposable razor blade and handle promised men safety and personal freedom to achieve the
          looks they desired.
        </p>
        <p class="my-3 text-justify">
          King C. Gillette's vision has inspired more than 100 years of innovation to bring you the
          best shave in the world. And, we’re not done yet.
